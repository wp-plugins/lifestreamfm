This is the only lifestream plugin that can stream your wikipedia edits.

= What are other reasons to choose this plugin over other lifestream plugins? =

This plugin uses lifestream.fm to stream your online life to your blog. Lifestream is better than other free online services I tried, like friendfeed. Because the hard thinking is done by lifestream.fm, the lifestream doesn't drain your wordpress resources. Lifestream.fm adds new possible streams all the time.
